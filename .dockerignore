# SSL Certificates (these should be volume-mounted at runtime, not built into the image)
# If your 'certs' directory is inside the build context and you only ever
# use volume mounts for them, you can uncomment the line below.
# However, if you want them copied as a fallback (not recommended for production secrets), keep it commented.
# For the CMD in your Dockerfile that references /app/certs, copying them via `COPY . .`
# and then overlaying with a volume mount is a common pattern.
